# 🔑 ID Generation in Hibernate (Summary)

Hibernate/JPA gives you several ways to generate primary keys. Each has different trade-offs depending on your **database** and **performance needs**.

Here’s the **all-in-one master summary** of Hibernate ID generation strategies (AUTO, SEQUENCE, IDENTITY, TABLE, UUID), including everything about batching, allocation, gaps, pros/cons, and when to use what.

---

## 1. `GenerationType.AUTO`

**Meaning**
Hibernate chooses the best strategy for the underlying database.

**Behavior (typical)**

* PostgreSQL / Oracle → `SEQUENCE`
* MySQL / MariaDB / SQL Server → `IDENTITY`
* If nothing else fits → `TABLE`

**Pros**

* Very simple, portable, no DB-specific code.

**Cons**

* Hibernate’s choice may change when you switch DBs → unpredictable performance.

**Use when**

* Portability > performance. Good for prototypes or apps that may switch DBs.

```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
private Long id;
```

---

## 2. `GenerationType.SEQUENCE`

**Meaning**
Use a **database sequence object** (`nextval` in PostgreSQL, `seq.NEXTVAL` in Oracle).

**How it works**

* Hibernate fetches IDs from the sequence.
* Can pre-fetch blocks of IDs (`allocationSize`).
* IDs are known **before insert**, so batching works well.

**Pros**

* Best **performance** with JDBC batching.
* IDs assigned in memory before flush.
* Efficient for high-volume inserts.

**Cons**

* Requires sequence object in DB (Hibernate can create one if allowed).
* With pooled allocation (`allocationSize > 1`), gaps appear.

**Use when**

* On PostgreSQL/Oracle (databases with strong sequence support).
* High-throughput insert-heavy workloads.

**Example**

```java
@Id
@SequenceGenerator(
    name = "user_seq_gen",
    sequenceName = "user_id_seq",
    allocationSize = 50 // prefetch 50 IDs at a time
)
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "user_seq_gen")
private Long id;
```

**SQL (PostgreSQL)**

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE user_id_seq START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;
```

---

## 3. `GenerationType.IDENTITY`

**Meaning**
Use DB’s **auto-increment/identity column**. The DB assigns IDs during `INSERT`.

**How it works**

* Hibernate issues the `INSERT`.
* The DB generates the ID.
* Hibernate fetches it afterward.

**Pros**

* Very simple.
* Fits MySQL / SQL Server defaults.
* No sequence object needed.

**Cons**

* Hibernate doesn’t know ID until **after insert** → batching is limited.
* Insert throughput lower than SEQUENCE.

**Use when**

* On MySQL / SQL Server (legacy schemas).
* When simplicity matters more than insert performance.

**Example**

```java
@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long id;
```

**DDL**

```sql
id BIGINT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY;
```

---

## 4. `GenerationType.TABLE`

**Meaning**
Use a **special table** as a pseudo-sequence.

**How it works**

* Hibernate stores current value in a table (`hibernate_sequences` or custom).
* Reads/updates the row to generate IDs.

**Pros**

* Portable to **any DB**, even those without sequences or identity.

**Cons**

* Slowest, requires extra table reads/writes.
* High contention under concurrency.

**Use when**

* Extreme portability is needed.
* Rare in modern production apps.

**Example**

```java
@Id
@TableGenerator(
    name = "user_tbl_gen",
    table = "id_generator",
    pkColumnName = "gen_name",
    valueColumnName = "gen_val",
    pkColumnValue = "user_id",
    allocationSize = 50
)
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE, generator = "user_tbl_gen")
private Long id;
```

**SQL**

```sql
CREATE TABLE id_generator (
  gen_name VARCHAR(64) PRIMARY KEY,
  gen_val BIGINT NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO id_generator (gen_name, gen_val) VALUES ('user_id', 1);
```

---

## 5. UUID / GUID (Hibernate-specific)

**Meaning**
Use `UUID` (128-bit identifier) instead of numeric IDs.

**How it works**

* Hibernate (6+) can generate UUIDs in the app (`@UuidGenerator`).
* Stored as `BINARY(16)` (compact) or `CHAR(36)` (readable) in DB.

**Pros**

* Globally unique — good for distributed systems.
* IDs generated **without DB round-trip**.
* Known **before persist** — useful for references/events.

**Cons**

* Larger (16 bytes vs 8).
* Random UUIDs fragment B-trees → prefer **time-ordered UUIDs (v7/ULID)**.
* Harder to debug than numbers.

**Use when**

* You need distributed ID generation across multiple services/nodes.
* You want IDs before hitting the DB.
* Microservices, offline clients, event-driven systems.

**Example (MySQL, compact storage)**

```java
@Id
@UuidGenerator
@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.BINARY) // store UUID in 16 bytes
@Column(columnDefinition = "BINARY(16)")
private UUID id;
```

**DDL**

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id BINARY(16) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  uuid_txt CHAR(36) AS (BIN_TO_UUID(id)) STORED
);
```

# ⚙️ Key Cross-Cutting Concepts

### 🔄 Batching

* JDBC batching = send multiple inserts in one round trip.
* Best with **SEQUENCE** (IDs known up front).
* Limited with **IDENTITY** (IDs only known after insert).
* Enable in Hibernate:

  ```properties
  hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=50
  ```

---

### 📦 Allocation / Prefetching

* With `SEQUENCE` and `TABLE`, Hibernate can **fetch blocks of IDs** using `allocationSize`.
* Example: `allocationSize=50` → Hibernate grabs 50 IDs and consumes them gradually.
* Benefits: fewer DB calls, better batching.
* Downsides: gaps if app crashes or restarts.

---

### ⚠️ Gaps

* All strategies may produce gaps:

    * Rollbacks
    * Crashes
    * Pooled allocations
* **Don’t use IDs as business order** — always add a `created_at` column.

| **IDENTITY** | MySQL / SQL Server (legacy schemas)   | Simple, DB-native                     | Weak batching, slower inserts |
| **TABLE**    | Exotic DBs, portability needed        | Works everywhere                      | Slow, contention-heavy        |
| **UUID**     | Distributed / microservices / offline | Global uniqueness, no DB round-trip   | Larger index, may fragment    |

# 🚀 Quick Rules of Thumb

* **High throughput inserts (Postgres/Oracle)** → `SEQUENCE` + batching.
* **MySQL/SQL Server legacy** → `IDENTITY`.
* **Distributed/microservices** → `UUID` (prefer time-ordered).
* **Extreme portability** → `TABLE`.
* **Don’t care / just starting** → `AUTO`.

---

✅ In short:

* Use **SEQUENCE** when you can (best batching).
* Use **IDENTITY** if schema/DB requires it.
* Use **UUID** if you need IDs outside the DB or in distributed systems.
* Expect **gaps** with any method.
* Never use PK for business ordering → add timestamps.

# MySQL

## UUID Primary Keys (Compact BINARY(16) Storage)

When using UUIDs as primary keys in MySQL, storing them as `CHAR(36)` strings is common but inefficient. A better approach is to store them in a compact binary format using `BINARY(16)`. This reduces storage space and improves index performance.


Here’s a tiny, end-to-end example of **UUID primary keys on MySQL**, stored compactly as `BINARY(16)` and generated in the app with Hibernate 6.

### 1) MySQL table (compact PK + easy-to-read helper)

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id BINARY(16) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,          -- packed UUID
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  -- Optional: human-readable mirror (handy for ad-hoc queries)
  uuid_txt CHAR(36) AS (BIN_TO_UUID(id)) STORED
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

> You don’t have to keep `uuid_txt`—it’s just convenient. The real PK is `BINARY(16)`.

### 2) Hibernate/JPA entity (Hibernate 6)

```java
import jakarta.persistence.*;
import java.time.Instant;
import java.util.UUID;
import org.hibernate.annotations.CreationTimestamp;
import org.hibernate.annotations.UuidGenerator;
import org.hibernate.annotations.JdbcTypeCode;
import org.hibernate.type.SqlTypes;

@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {

  @Id
  @UuidGenerator // generates java.util.UUID in the app (no DB round-trip)
  @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.BINARY)               // map UUID -> BINARY(16)
  @Column(name = "id", columnDefinition = "BINARY(16)")
  private UUID id;

  @Column(nullable = false)
  private String name;

  @CreationTimestamp
  @Column(name = "created_at", nullable = false, updatable = false)
  private Instant createdAt;

  // getters/setters ...
}
```

> If your Hibernate exposes a time-ordered style, you can do
> `@UuidGenerator(style = UuidGenerator.Style.TIME)` to reduce index fragmentation vs random v4.

### 3) Spring/JPA settings (example)

```properties
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none          # or update/create at your own risk
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=50
```

### 4) Using it

```java
User u = new User();
u.setName("Alice");
userRepository.save(u);          // Hibernate generates UUID in-memory and sends as 16 bytes
System.out.println(u.getId());   // you already have the ID before insert
```

### 5) Handy SQL when querying manually

```sql
-- Find by a textual UUID
SELECT id, name, created_at
FROM users
WHERE id = UUID_TO_BIN('550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000');

-- See the UUIDs in text form (thanks to the generated column)
SELECT uuid_txt, name, created_at FROM users;
```

### Notes & options

* **Why `BINARY(16)`?** 2× smaller than `CHAR(36)`, faster indexes.
* **Time-ordered UUIDs:** Random v4 UUIDs fragment B-trees. Prefer **v7** (time-ordered) if possible:

    * Generate UUIDv7 in your code (library) and assign it to `id` before `save()`, or
    * Use a Hibernate generator with a time-ordered style if your version supports it.
* **MySQL’s `UUID_TO_BIN(..., 1)` trick:** When you generate IDs **in SQL** (not here), using `UUID_TO_BIN(uuid, 1)` stores bytes in a time-friendly order. If you go that route, be consistent and also read with `BIN_TO_UUID(id, 1)`. With Hibernate generating IDs as Java `UUID`, you typically stick to the straightforward mapping above (no swap flag).

# FAQs: UUID vs SEQUENCE vs IDENTITY



## 1) When to pick UUID / GUID (Hibernate 6)

Choose a UUID/GUID primary key when one or more of these are true:

* **You need to generate IDs outside the DB** (e.g., in services, message producers, offline/mobile clients) and later upsert/merge in the DB.
* **You have multiple writer nodes / multi-region** and want globally unique IDs without coordinating with the DB first.
* **You want to avoid an extra DB round-trip** per ID assignment (helpful when using `IDENTITY`, or when you don’t want to call a sequence).
* **You want stable IDs before persistence** (useful for building relationships in memory, emitting events, logs, URLs, etc.).
* **You’re using an event-driven or CQRS setup** and need IDs as soon as aggregates are created.

### Trade-offs

* **Pros:** globally unique across services, no DB trip to get an ID, easy replication/sharding, IDs exist before insert.
* **Cons:** bigger indexes; random UUIDs (v4) **fragment B-trees** and bloat indexes. Prefer **time-ordered** IDs (UUIDv7, v1, ULID-style) to keep inserts mostly append-only and indexes tighter.

### Practical mapping tips

* PostgreSQL: use `uuid` column type.
* MySQL/MariaDB: use `BINARY(16)` and store packed UUIDs (don’t store as 36-char strings).
* SQL Server: `UNIQUEIDENTIFIER`.
* Oracle: `RAW(16)`.

Hibernate 6 examples:

```java
// Postgres-friendly
@Id
@org.hibernate.annotations.UuidGenerator // Hibernate 6
@org.hibernate.annotations.JdbcTypeCode(org.hibernate.type.SqlTypes.UUID)
@Column(columnDefinition = "uuid")
private java.util.UUID id;

// MySQL-friendly (packed)
@Id
@org.hibernate.annotations.UuidGenerator
@org.hibernate.annotations.JdbcTypeCode(org.hibernate.type.SqlTypes.BINARY)
@Column(columnDefinition = "BINARY(16)")
private java.util.UUID id;
```

(If your Hibernate version exposes a “time” style for the generator, use it to get time-ordered UUIDs.)

---

## 2) “If we can pre-order IDs with SEQUENCE, why do we need IDENTITY? Can we pre-fetch 50 and use them one by one?”

### Yes, you can pre-fetch and reuse

With **`GenerationType.SEQUENCE`** plus `@SequenceGenerator(allocationSize = 50)`, Hibernate will fetch a **block of 50 IDs** from the DB sequence and **cache them in memory**. It then consumes those IDs:

* for **batched inserts**, or
* for **individual inserts over time**, **until the block is exhausted**,
* then it fetches the next block automatically.

This is **not** limited to a single “batch operation”. It’s a pool that gets used as your app persists entities. Note you may see **gaps** (e.g., app restarts with unused IDs in the block).

```java
@Id
@SequenceGenerator(
  name = "user_seq",
  sequenceName = "user_id_seq",
  allocationSize = 50 // prefetch 50 at a time
)
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "user_seq")
private Long id;
```

### So… why use IDENTITY at all?

`IDENTITY` remains common because:

* **Database choice / legacy:** MySQL and SQL Server schemas traditionally rely on identity/auto-increment. Many shops, tools, and DBAs default to it.
* **Simplicity:** No separate sequence object to manage. One column with `AUTO_INCREMENT`/`IDENTITY`.
* **Existing systems & tooling:** ETL, ORM defaults, migration scripts, audit triggers, etc., may expect identity columns.
* **DB feature set:** Some environments don’t use sequences; identity is the “native” and operationally familiar option.

Downside: with `IDENTITY`, Hibernate learns the key **after** each insert, which weakens true JDBC insert batching. (That’s exactly why sequences or UUIDs tend to perform better for heavy write loads.)

---

## Quick chooser

* **High write throughput on Postgres/Oracle:** `SEQUENCE` + `allocationSize` (pooled) + JDBC batching.
* **Multi-service / offline ID generation / pre-persistence IDs:** **UUID** (prefer time-ordered variants).
* **Legacy MySQL/SQL Server or simplest ops:** **IDENTITY** is fine; accept weaker batching.
* **Maximum portability to odd DBs:** `TABLE` (understand it’s slower).

### Extra tips

* Don’t rely on PK order for business sorting; use created_at or a business key.
* Expect **gaps** with any strategy (rollbacks, pooling, restarts).
* If you use UUIDs on MySQL, store as `BINARY(16)` and consider time-ordered UUIDs (e.g., v7) to reduce index fragmentation.
